adminHandler** This attribute does not need to be set.  If used, this attribute should be set to the FQN (Fully qualified name) of a class that inherits from CoreAdminHandler. For example, <str name="adminHandler">com.myorg.MyAdminHandler</str> would configure the custom admin handler (MyAdminHandler) to handle admin requests.   If this attribute isnt set, Solr uses the default admin handler, org.apache.solr.handler.admin.CoreAdminHandler.  **N/A
collectionsHandler** As above, for custom CollectionsHandler implementations. **N/A
infoHandler** As above, for custom InfoHandler implementations. **N/A
coreLoadThreads** Specifies the number of threads that will be assigned to load cores in parallel. **N/A
coreRootDirectory** The root of the core discovery tree, defaults to $SOLR_HOME (by default, server/solr). **N/A
managementPath** Currently non-operational. **N/A
sharedLib** Specifies the path to a common library directory that will be shared across all cores. Any JAR files in this directory will be added to the search path for Solr plugins. This path is relative to $SOLR_HOME. Custom handlers may be placed in this directory. **N/A
shareSchema** This attribute, when set to true, ensures that the multiple cores pointing to the same Schema resource file will be referring to the same IndexSchema Object. Sharing the IndexSchema Object makes loading the core faster. If you use this feature, make sure that no core-specific property is used in your Schema file. **N/A
transientCacheSize** Defines how many cores with transient=true that can be loaded before swapping the least recently used core for a new core. **N/A
configSetBaseDir** The directory under which configSets for Solr cores can be found. Defaults to $SOLR_HOME/configsets. **N/A
distribUpdateConnTimeout** Used to set the underlying connTimeout for intra-cluster updates. **N/A
distribUpdateSoTimeout** Used to set the underlying socketTimeout for intra-cluster updates. **N/A
host** The hostname Solr uses to access cores. **N/A
hostContext** The url context path. **N/A
hostPort** The port Solr uses to access cores.  In the default solr.xml file, this is set to ${jetty.port:8983}, which will use the Solr port defined in Jetty, and otherwise fall back to 8983.  **N/A
leaderVoteWait** When SolrCloud is starting up, how long each Solr node will wait for all known replicas for that shard to be found before assuming that any nodes that havent reported are down. **N/A
leaderConflictResolveWait** When trying to elect a leader for a shard, this property sets the maximum time a replica will wait to see conflicting state information to be resolved; temporary conflicts in state information can occur when doing rolling restarts, especially when the node hosting the Overseer is restarted.  Typically, the default value of 180000 (ms) is sufficient for conflicts to be resolved; you may need to increase this value if you have hundreds or thousands of small collections in SolrCloud.  **N/A
zkClientTimeout** A timeout for connection to a ZooKeeper server. It is used with SolrCloud. **N/A
zkHost** In SolrCloud mode, the URL of the ZooKeeper host that Solr should use for cluster state information. **N/A
genericCoreNodeNames** If TRUE, node names are not based on the address of the node, but on a generic name that identifies the core. When a different machine takes over serving that core things will be much easier to understand. **N/A
zkCredentialsProvider & zkACLProvider** Optional parameters that can be specified if you are using ZooKeeper Access Control. **N/A
class** The class to use for logging. The corresponding JAR file must be available to Solr, perhaps through a <lib> directive in solrconfig.xml. **N/A
enabled** true/false - whether to enable logging or not. **N/A
socketTimeout** The read timeout for intra-cluster query and administrative requests. The default is the same as the distribUpdateSoTimeout specified in the <solrcloud> section. **N/A
connTimeout** The connection timeout for intra-cluster query and administrative requests. Defaults to the distribUpdateConnTimeout specified in the <solrcloud> section. **N/A
urlScheme** The URL scheme to be used in distributed search. **N/A
maxConnectionsPerHost** Maximum connections allowed per host. Defaults to 20. **N/A
maxConnections** Maximum total connections allowed. Defaults to 10000. **N/A
corePoolSize** The initial core size of the threadpool servicing requests. Default is 0. **N/A
maximumPoolSize** The maximum size of the threadpool servicing requests. Default is unlimited. **N/A
maxThreadIdleTime** The amount of time in seconds that idle threads persist for in the queue, before being killed. Default is 5 seconds. **N/A
sizeOfQueue** If the threadpool uses a backing queue, what is its maximum size to use direct handoff. Default is to use a SynchronousQueue. **N/A
fairnessPolicy** A boolean to configure if the threadpool favors fairness over throughput. Default is false to favor throughput. **N/A
